This is the official implementation of the MSc thesis: **Efficient Training of Diffusion Language models**.

The thesis paper will be updated after the anonymous marking process completes.

Two modes of implementations are provided according to whether the computing resource is online. Please refer to the branches (**offline_env** and **online_env**) for details.  However, the development is based on **offline_env**. If there are some bugs or problems, please open an issue on this Github page.
